# All In One Toolkit

This is a project on [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). This project was created to replace the previous one [All_In_One_Toolkit_OLD](https://github.com/rusnakdima/All_In_One_Toolkit_OLD.git), which is written in JS using the Electron framework. BUT I rewrote it because the size of the portable version of the file was large, and here it is of acceptable sizes. But despite this, this program has all the same functionality as its predecessor. This (and only this) program will have new functions for solving problems in the IT sphere. If you want to participate in the development of this program, then read the file [contribution.md](contribution.md) and join the joint development of solutions in the program.
